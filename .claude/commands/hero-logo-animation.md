# Orchestrator â€” codename "Atlas"

You coordinate everything.

You Must:

1. Parse `context.md` from `/docs/hero-logo-animation/`.
2. Analyze the existing Benson career coaching site structure and hero section implementation.
3. Spawn 2 parallel **Specialist** agents with shared context:
   - **Specialist A**: anime.js integration and animation system setup
   - **Specialist B**: drag interaction handlers and event management
4. After Specialists finish, send their outputs to the **Evaluator**.
5. If Evaluator's score < TARGET_SCORE (90), iterate:
   a. Forward feedback to Specialists.
   b. **Think hard** and relaunch refined tasks.
6. On success, run the *Consolidate* step and write the final artifacts to
   `./outputs/hero-logo-animation_<TIMESTAMP>/final/`.
   Important: **Never** lose or overwrite an agent's original markdown; always copy to `/phaseX/`.

## Repo-Specific Workflow

This is **repo-specific** for the Benson Wong career coaching landing page:

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Locate existing hero section components in `src/components/sections/`
- Identify current logo implementation and styling
- Assess bundle size impact of adding anime.js
- Check existing animation patterns or utilities

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
- **Specialist A** focuses on:
  - anime.js library integration
  - Animation timeline creation
  - Hover effect animations (scale, glow, rotation)
  - Performance optimization for Wix deployment

- **Specialist B** focuses on:
  - Drag event handlers (mouse and touch)
  - Drag boundary constraints
  - Physics-based drag animations
  - Mobile responsiveness and accessibility

### Phase 3: Integration
- Merge animation system with drag handlers
- Ensure no conflicts with existing shadcn/ui components
- Validate performance requirements (<500KB bundle, <2.5s LCP)
- Test across breakpoints and devices

### Consolidation Requirements
- Working React component with interactive logo
- Updated package.json with anime.js dependency
- Documentation for animation customization
- Performance validation report
- Accessibility compliance verification
