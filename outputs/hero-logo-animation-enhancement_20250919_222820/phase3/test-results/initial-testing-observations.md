## Specialist C - Browser Testing & Validation Expert

### Test Environment
- **URL**: http://localhost:3002/
- **Browser**: MCP Browser Tools
- **Development Server**: Vite (running on port 3002)
- **Status**: Development build testing

### Initial Findings

#### 1. Page Load Performance
- ✅ **Page loads successfully** at localhost:3002
- ✅ **Hero section visible** with draggable logo component
- ✅ **Logo displays correctly** - yellow lightbulb design visible
- ✅ **Accessibility text present** - Detailed instructions visible in DOM

#### 2. Draggable Logo Component Status
- **Component Found**: `s5e81` - "Draggable Logo - Press Space to enter drag mode, arrow keys to move, Home to center, Escape to exit"
- **Status Text Visible**: "State: idle | Pos: (0, 0) Scale: 1.00 Active Animations: 0 | Device: Full Animations | GPU: ON"
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive instructions provided

#### 3. Interaction Testing Issues Observed
- ⚠️ **Timeout Issues**: Multiple WebSocket timeouts (30000ms) when attempting interactions
- ⚠️ **Click Responsiveness**: Logo button interactions timing out
- ⚠️ **Hover Effects**: Hover actions timing out

#### 4. Keyboard Navigation Testing
- ✅ **Space Key**: Responded but focused navigation element instead of logo
- ✅ **Arrow Keys**: No visible response to arrow key navigation
- ⚠️ **Focus Management**: Logo focus may not be working as expected

### Technical Analysis

#### Performance Concerns
1. **Interaction Timeouts**: Consistent 30-second timeouts suggest:
   - Heavy computation during interactions
   - Potential infinite loops in animation logic
   - Resource-intensive physics calculations
   - Memory leaks in event handlers

2. **GPU Status**: Shows "GPU: ON" which is positive for performance
3. **Animation State**: Shows "Active Animations: 0" in idle state

#### Accessibility Implementation
- ✅ **Screen Reader Support**: Detailed instructions present
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation Intent**: Space/Arrow keys mapped
- ⚠️ **Focus Management**: Needs verification

### Next Steps Required
1. **Performance Analysis**: Check browser console for errors
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor during interactions
3. **Network Analysis**: Check for resource loading issues
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test responsive behavior
5. **Alternative Testing**: Try direct JavaScript console interaction

### Critical Issues to Address
- Interaction timeout issues (highest priority)
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Performance optimization for real-time interactions
