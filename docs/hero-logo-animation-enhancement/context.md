# Hero Logo Animation Enhancement - Shared Context

## Task Overview
**Primary Goal**: Ultrathink and enhance the animated logo in the hero section to significantly increase interactivity and user engagement.

**Project Context**: Benson Wong Career Coaching Landing Page
- Tech Stack: React 18 + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- Target: Bilingual career coaching website for Chinese-speaking professionals in Australia
- Current State: Basic animated logo exists, needs major interactivity upgrades

## Current Animation Assets
Based on git status and file structure:
- `src/components/AnimatedHeroLogo.tsx` - Base animated logo component
- `src/components/DraggableHeroLogo.tsx` - Draggable variant
- `src/components/EnhancedDraggableHeroLogo.tsx` - Enhanced version
- `src/lib/animations.ts` - Animation utilities
- `src/lib/dragUtils.ts` - Drag interaction utilities
- `src/pages/executive-wisdom/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Hero section implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Constraints
- Bundle size impact: <50KB additional
- Animation performance: 60fps minimum
- Mobile responsiveness: All interactions must work on touch devices
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant interactions

### Browser MCP Integration
**Critical**: All specialists must use browser MCP tools to:
1. Launch development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to the hero section
3. Interact with animations in real-time
4. Capture screenshots of enhanced states
5. Validate performance using browser console
6. Test across different viewport sizes

### Enhancement Categories

#### Visual Enhancements
- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- Particle effects or subtle motion graphics
- Color transitions that align with brand palette
- Micro-interactions and delightful details

#### Interactivity Features
- Multi-touch gesture support
- Hover states with meaningful feedback
- Click/tap interactions with visual rewards
- Drag interactions with physics-based responses
- Keyboard navigation support

#### Contextual Behaviors
- Time-of-day adaptive animations
- Scroll-triggered animation phases
- Mouse tracking for dynamic responses
- Loading state animations

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Component composition over inheritance
- Custom hooks for animation logic
- Proper error boundaries for animation failures
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for animation logic
- Integration tests for user interactions
- Performance benchmarks (Frame rate, bundle size)
- Cross-browser compatibility validation
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

## Browser MCP Testing Protocol

Each specialist must execute this testing sequence:

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Browser Navigation**
   - Navigate to localhost:5173
   - Take initial screenshot
   - Inspect hero section animations

3. **Interactive Testing**
   - Test all mouse interactions
   - Validate touch gestures (dev tools mobile mode)
   - Check keyboard navigation
   - Monitor console for errors

4. **Performance Validation**
   - Open browser performance tab
   - Record animation performance
   - Measure frame rates during interactions
   - Check memory usage patterns

5. **Documentation**
   - Screenshot key interaction states
   - Record performance metrics
   - Document any discovered issues
   - Note optimization opportunities

## Constraints and Considerations

### Brand Alignment
- Must maintain professional career coaching aesthetic
- Color palette: Primary blues, accent gold, neutral grays
- Target audience: Chinese-speaking professionals (ages 25-45)
- Cultural sensitivity in animation choices

### Technical Limitations
- Wix platform compatibility required
- No external animation libraries beyond what's reasonable
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Development Timeline
- Phase 1: Analysis and enhanced visuals (Specialist A)
- Phase 2: Advanced interactivity implementation (Specialist B)
- Phase 3: Browser MCP validation and testing (Specialist C)
- Evaluation cycles until TARGET_SCORE achieved
- Final consolidation and deliverable preparation

## Shared Resources
- Project root: `/Users/kyseah/Documents/GitHub/benson-page-2`
- Development server: `npm run dev` (localhost:5173)
- Test command: `npm test`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Browser MCP tools available for real-time testing

All specialists must leverage the **ultrathink** approach for innovative solutions while maintaining practical implementation focus.
