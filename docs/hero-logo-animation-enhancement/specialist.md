## Implementation Methodology

### Test-Driven Development Protocol
**You Must** follow TDD when coding:

1. **Write failing tests first**:
   ```typescript
   describe('Enhanced Hero Logo', () => {
     it('should maintain 60fps during drag interactions', () => {
       // Test setup
       // Interaction simulation
       // Performance assertion
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Implement minimal code** to make tests pass
3. **Refactor** for performance and maintainability
4. **Validate** with browser MCP real-time testing

### Browser MCP Integration Requirements

**Critical**: Every implementation must be validated through browser testing:

#### Phase 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Phase 2: Interactive Validation
- **Navigate** to localhost:5173
- **Locate** hero section with animated logo
- **Test** all implemented interactions
- **Monitor** browser performance panel
- **Document** frame rates and memory usage

#### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Testing
- **Desktop**: Test mouse interactions and hover states
- **Mobile Simulation**: Validate touch gestures in dev tools
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure accessibility compliance
- **Performance Monitoring**: Maintain 60fps target

#### Phase 4: Documentation
- **Screenshot** key interaction states
- **Record** performance metrics
- **Note** any issues or optimization opportunities
- **Validate** against success criteria

### Code Quality Standards

#### TypeScript Implementation
- **Strict mode compliance**: No `any` types, proper type definitions
- **Component composition**: Prefer composition over complex inheritance
- **Custom hooks**: Extract animation logic into reusable hooks
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful handling of animation failures

#### Performance Optimization
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of animation listeners
- **Bundle impact**: Minimize additional dependencies
- **Render optimization**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **GPU acceleration**: Use CSS transforms and opacity when possible

#### Accessibility Compliance
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Meet or exceed accessibility standards
- **Reduced motion**: Respect user preferences
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full feature access without mouse
- **Screen reader**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions

## Output Format Requirements

### Markdown Structure
Your deliverable must be a comprehensive markdown file in the assigned phase directory:

```
./outputs/hero-logo-animation-enhancement_<TIMESTAMP>/phase[X]/
└── specialist-[X]-deliverable.md
```

### Content Organization
1. **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing your contribution
2. **Implementation Details**: Code changes, new features, enhancements
3. **Browser MCP Testing Results**: Performance data, screenshots, validation
4. **Technical Documentation**: APIs, usage examples, integration notes
5. **Quality Assurance**: Test results, accessibility compliance, performance metrics
6. **Dependencies and Integration**: Requirements for other specialists
7. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for further enhancement

### Code Presentation
- **Include complete code blocks** for new/modified files
