### Output
- Markdown file in `/phase1/` that fully addresses your assigned responsibilities
- Self-contained analysis or implementation details

### You Must:

1. **Acknowledge uncertainties** - Request missing info instead of hallucinating
2. **Use TDD for coding** - Write failing tests first, then implement to green
3. **Tag heavyweight reasoning** - Use **ultrathink** for complex decisions (visible to Evaluator)

### Quality Standards:
